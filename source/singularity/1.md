- [Artists, Developers, and The Deep Structures of The New World](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/28/artists-developers-deep-structures-new-world)
- Consciousness is a virtual world, that has been trying to reach out and colonize our reality, in all of our various art forms
- Social media has exploded to fill the canvas
- Film, writing, music started out on different ends of the canvas, but are trying to converge
- [Technology and the Baroque Unconscious](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/11/11/technology-and-the-baroque-unconscious/)
