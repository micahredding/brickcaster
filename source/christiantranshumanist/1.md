> "Transhumanism is at heart altruistic. You are not working for your own account. It's not about salivating upon hearing of a new technological consumer gadget or even trying to achieve personal immortality. You work for all, for a future with more options, more freedom, more safety, less hunger, less poverty, less death. Ultimately it's about creating a world with more good and less bad in it." - [Koen De Paus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/457984804375784/permalink/508009509373313/)
