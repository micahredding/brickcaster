In this episode, Micah interviews world-traveling science fiction writer Colin Wright. A kid hears voices, stops taking his meds, and suddenly finds them directing him into the middle of a vast web of power and intrigue. A hacktivism group works against a singularity cult leader to crypto-free the world. These are the kind of ideas explored in Colin's writings, and we dig into them here!
