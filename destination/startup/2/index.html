    <p>You&#39;re about to embark on a massive software project. What are you getting into? Are you building the pyramids or the botanical gardens? Is this a build-it-and-walk-away situation, or an ongoing endeavor requiring loving care and upkeep? Know what you&#39;re getting into, and learn how to think about the significance of your role in the project. <a href="http://brickcaster.com/startup/2" target="_blank">Read our detailed notes here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>

<p>You do planning &emdash; but you have to be open to change. Sometimes you have to move things around, sometimes things die, sometimes you have to replace them.</p>

<p><strong>A process of learning and discovery</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s an element of discovery. This tool isn&#39;t quite what we thought it was — this library needs to be replaced — we aren&#39;t building the same thing twice.</p>

<p>We&#39;re learning about the tools, we&#39;re learning about the problem space, we&#39;re learning about the business.</p>

<p><strong>We&#39;re not building the same thing twice</strong></p>

<p>You could buy a ready-made garden off the shelf. But when you want to add something new, you need to start over.</p>

<p>When you&#39;ve got well-defined problems (Wordpress blog, simple ecommerce) pre-packaged solutions make sense. But when you&#39;re building something new, for a new business case, then you approach it as a learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>The environment changes as well</strong></p>

<p>The environment (not just the tools) might be changing. The business need and business setting may be changing during the process of development.</p>

<p><strong>Software is soft, buildings are not</strong></p>

<p>Boundaries around what you&#39;re building tend to be much more ambiguous.</p>

<p>Plants have roots. Those roots can become entangled. That can create problems.</p>

<p>Developers deal with this problem: how to keep entanglements down. How to keep your software flexible. How to make sure that when you remove this one feature, other features down come with it.</p>

<p>This often depends on really understanding the way your business concepts actually interrelate at a deep level. Misunderstandings up front lead to unwanted entanglements.</p>

<p>Allowing for flexibility allows us to discover and work around potential entanglements.</p>

<p><strong>The well maintained garden produces more</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A garden needs maintained over time.</li>
<li>Software has a life-cycle.</li>
<li>It will be a different thing six months out, a year out, two years out.</li>
<li>You need professional cultivators.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You could cultivate:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Simple projects yourself.</li>
<li>Mid-tier projects can bring in professionals periodically.</li>
<li>Larger projects need full-time professional care.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s never done, never finished, always growing, always changing.</p>

<p><strong>Web development offers the ability to deploy more often</strong></p>
